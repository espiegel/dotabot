First blood, as indeed I am first in everything.
Did I hear a squeak?
I must have stepped on something.
Whatever that was, twas scarcely worth my notice.
Whosoever stands against me, stands briefly.
Fools die…as you well know.
Give it not a second thought.
Mark these words: they're the last you'll hear.
Your ignorance ensured your demise.
You'd have done better to clothe yourself in knowledge, for all the good your scraps of armor did you.
You die as you lived: insipid and ignorant.
You were no match for my powers. But then, who is?
Like a match already dim and damp, your mind snuffs out.
I outlive another.
