First blood! From a deep-cut notch, the red sap flows.
Where the path branched, you chose unwisely.
That will teach you to assail the defenseless.
That was more than merely justified.
You'll have to live longer than that to merit my esteem.
Ah, fresh fertilizer.
Even the grasses deserve to eat.
Mmm. A fern might grow there someday.
Oh ho! Is that all it took?
A little respect for the forest, please.
The dirt may have you.
A tree killed you. A tree!
You look like mulch.
Rooted you out.
I protected you to a pulp.
Leaf me alone.
You were nasty, brutal, and most of all short.
By my bark!
That's enough now, little tree.
Axe! I will fear you no more.
Even but warm ash is to be feared.
We could do with fewer of you firestarters out here.
Frost and flame? This will not do.
Ah! Much nicer without the hellfire.
Someone put a bounty on a tree?
I believe you might have been barking up the wrong tree.
You may be the only one here who is slower than I.
I will happily bury your hatchets.
Your pebbles will give way to we that grow.
We could do with fewer such contraptions.
It seems only fitting that you have a log jammed up--oh, but where are my manners.
Well! I think I enjoyed that.
One less lumberjack.
Keep your hot little hands away from me, Lina.
That'll teach you to raise your leg at me.
A snack for the earth.
