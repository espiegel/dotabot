Hmm. Where's a tree when you need one.
How forgetful of me. We need a tree.
My shade may be insufficient.
Can't see the forest for the trees.
Rot from within.
This will hurt you more than it does us.
Nature is not always kind.
Grow and perish.
Life, and death.
Gone to seed.
Toughen up!
Come into my shade.
A bit more bark, if you please.
Ah! That's more like it.
Creepers, hold them fast.
Make like a tree, and stay put.
Would you look at that!
Take root. Go on, take it!
Rooted in place.
They say my bark is worse than my bite. I wonder what that means.
Hmm? I feel a new branch coming in.
Like a drink of fresh spring water.
Why hunt the tide, hunter?
Let us rattle some trees, Earthshaker.
Venomancer, give them nature's potency.
Mind you! Don't burn any trees I like, Jakiro.
Show them an ogre's brilliance, Magi.
Let them not threaten the grove, Enchantress.
I'll be at your side, Wisp.
Greetings, little tree.
A snack for the earth.
Life becomes death becomes new life. As it should be.
I protect that which cannot protect itself. But what protects me?
I would like nothing more than to plant myself in the sunshine, next to a cool stream.
This lets me move how fast?
What a fancy twig!
I'm going out on a limb here.
