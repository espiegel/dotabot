No!
Darkness and ignorance take you all!
My magics die with me.
An end to ages of learning.
The archives of time are lost with me.
Outside my mind, nothing is real.
All that matters, perishes with me.
It was…not enough.
Forget me not!
Wex…Quas…Exorrr…aggghhh…
Dead loss.
The final tabulation.
Put me out of your mind.
Remember me, for I will remember you!
Death is but a lapse in my concentration…
