Invoker!
Glorious invocation!
What joy it is beholding me!
Thus I invoke myself!
So begins a new age of knowledge.
I return with nary a mark upon me.
I remember now what I was about.
I shall be mindful, make no mistake.
Recalled from the yonside of death.
The universe was not the same without me.
With my return, the cosmos is restored.
All knowledge is parallel.
A line without beginning, a line without end.
From the source of self-knowledge, the well of creation, I return.
Knowing All can be known, and known by me.
The universe depends on what I can remember of it.
From the first point was begat a line. From this line was begat a world. And that first point was one I made.
Carl!
Throughout the aeons I have been known by many names… But my true name of power… is Carl.
Behold before you, the illustrious, the imperious, ingenious arch-mage… CARL.
