No!
Ah, couldn't care less.
Wake up, girl! Wake up…
It… happens…
Thought I could tough it out.
Had to happen ohhhhh….
Crashed and burned.
Hard landing, oof.
She deserved a better death.
I'll join you in death, old girl.
Lay her down softly.
No such thing as a free ride.
Road rash…ohhh…
I been rat-packed…ohh…
Baggin' out.
