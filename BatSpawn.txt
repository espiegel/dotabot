There's no taming me!
I rode mine here!
Got a bat's eye view of the battle.
If you don't ride into battle, you don't ride at all.
Life just got interesting!
Light then throw. Light then throw.
Gonna ride this bat outta hell like a bat outta hell!
Nothin like the feel of my old bat between my legs.
Back from the boneyard!
Now where'd I put my brainbucket?
Hey, did someone hide my chaps?
Hoo, hit a crosswind back there!
Gone but not forgotten.
Me an my hognose, hittin the lanes!
Time for a little lane rage!
Sorry, I had to bail.
Rekindled.
You wanna rough? All right, we'll rough.
Ho, bat! Let's fly!
Once more into the wind.
Who called me an airhead?
I lift off once more.
Back into the fight.
Fire from the sky.
Which way to the belfry?
Ee-haw! That's my signal.
