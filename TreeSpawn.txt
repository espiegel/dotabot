Someone requires my protection!
The seasons wheel past in a blur.
Thoughts cross my mind as the sun crosses the sky.
The time has come, and will soon be gone.
From shade to sun.
My sap is rising!
Ah, light! I welcome you!
Even the light of the moon feels warm upon my bark.
Think me not ponderous, merely pondering.
What a lovely day.
What a lovely evening.
I believe I have always been here.
I think I'll go for a nice walk.
Now... where was I?
I rather enjoyed that break.
Hmm. Back to war.
Spring comes again.
This was all an open meadow just moments ago.
A battle! Has that always been there?
Hmm? I feel a new branch coming in.
